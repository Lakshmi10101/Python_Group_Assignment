# Python_Group_Assignment

This repository takes the abstact base class for searching and sorting lists and implements codes for Linear Search, Binary Search, Merge Sort and Bubble Sort using four different classes. 

The search algorithms have been organized into the same module file Search.py

Similarly, the sorting algorithms have also been organized into the same module file named Sort.py

The code also provides for an analysis of the changes in the execution time with input size between each of the searching an sorting algorithms by ploting a graph for each category.
